I've recommended it in the past and will do so in the future. My many years and diverse background in Startups in many different fields and locations can help Parse strategically grow -- getting to the first million in revenue is always a challenge, but a rewarding one. I'm a generalist, quick to pick up new languages and skills, recently focusing on PhoneGap and Mobile App Development. You probably will not find out much about me online (intentionally), but it's common for me to get an award or recognition for the breadth and clarity of my answers (see URLs below). I'll be in the Bay Area for a week after the 4th of July. I'd like to set up an interview or informal discussion while I'm still in California.", "urls":  ["Coding:", "https://github.com/josher19", "Cover Letter", "http://josher19.github.com/parse-where/html/cover.html", "Resume", "http://josher19.github.com/parse-where/html/JSW_Resume.doc",  "Suggestions from improving Javascript Docs", "https://github.com/josher19/parse-where/wiki/Parse.com-Javascript-Guide", "", "Prize by Jeremy Ashkenas (author of Backbone.js) for early recommendations for improving the CoffeeScript language:", "https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/issues/92",  "Awards/Badges for my first two Answers on StackExchange (in top 36% despite only 4 answers and 1 question)", "http://stackoverflow.com/users/508994/user508994",  "Rated a Master of Javascript and Google-fu:", "http://smarterer.com/josher19", "LinkedIn profile:", "http://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuashaneweinstein", "Other interests:", "http://about.me/joshuaweinstein"] }
